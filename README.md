# University-Projects
This repo contains all concrete projects done through my studies. 


MAIN COURSES
LFSAB1501 Plane pulling tractor
We were asked to design and dimension a plane-pulling tractor that could pull a plane from its terminal to the runway. Currently, this is done using the plane's reactors which have
very poor efficiency. The first year students in civil engineering were asked to dimension a concrete tractor. Once that was done and validated, they were asked to 
program a miniature robot made with lego technics to do the task. This project contains the report detailling the coices made for the real machine aswell as the code of the model.


LFSAB1502 Metal detecting stick
This project familiarized us with electrical components like capacitors and inductors. We were asked to create a metal-detector using only resistors, capacitors and an op amp.

LFSAB1503 Hydrogen production
We were asked to analyze the most effective way to produce Hydrogen. We compared electrolysys versius vaporeformage. Once the process was chosen, we computed the in and out volumes
and the size of the furnaces, towers,... 


ELECTRICITY

LELEC1101 - Piano and noise cancelling
We designed an electric piano and noise cancelling headphones using only basic electric components like transistors and op amps. No clocks or digital circuits were allowed.
